Chat Server Application
Contributions
I developed this chat server application entirely on my own. 

Prerequisites
Python 3.x


Run the server using the following command:
python chat.py [port_number]
Enter a valid port number when prompted if not provided in the command.

Commands
help: Shows help information.
myip: Displays your IP address.
myport: Displays your listening port.
connect <IP> <Port>: Connects to another server.
list: Lists connections.
terminate <ID>: Ends a connection.
send <ID> <Message>: Sends a message.
exit: Exits the application.
